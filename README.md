## Developed with ReactJS and React Native. I'm using json-server (read more on [JSON-Server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) to simulate an RESTFul API.

** Used Technologies **
- React
  - React Router DOM
- React Native
  - React Navigation
- Redux
- Redux Saga
- Reactotron
- Axios
- Prop-Types
- Styled Components
- Reactotron (test application)

- Dev Dependencies

*Avaliable scripts*

## Web
  
  **To run the project -**
  ```
  yarn start / npm start
  ```

## Mobile

  **You need to have an Android Emulator running to use this commands.**

  ###### If 'react-native cli' is already installed globaly in your machine, you can run

  **To install app in your Android Device -**
  ```
  react-native run-android
  ```

  **After installed, you need only start the server to use the app. For this, run**
  ```
  react-native start
  ```
  
###### Make sure that json-server is running at 3333 port.
